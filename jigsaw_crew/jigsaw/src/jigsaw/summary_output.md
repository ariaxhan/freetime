The Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco is a suspension bridge known for its distinctive red-orange color and impressive size. It spans the Golden Gate strait, connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The bridge was completed in 1937 and was the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time. It has since been surpassed in length but remains an iconic symbol of San Francisco and a popular tourist attraction. Visitors can learn about the bridge's history and design at the Bridge Pavilion and other exhibits, or simply enjoy the views from one of the many viewpoints in the area. The bridge is also a vital transportation link, carrying vehicles and pedestrians between San Francisco and Marin County.
